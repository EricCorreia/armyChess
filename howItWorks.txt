// WHAT TO DO
// - build game Board
// - make mock up army to test with
// - Create the process of the differnt acts of the turn
// - then make sure controlls are all good inculding having all the units clickable on the side.
// - Test and make sure it all works (give it to kylee and tim to also test)
// - make website look pretty
// - make more armies
// - make army special ablites
// - update git regurally


// HOW GAME WILL LOOK
// - game board will be chess like with more spaces. (either 10 by 10 or 10 by 15)
// - game will have units that are just little tiles with symbols on it and the wound count.
      // - the little shapes generals used to show troop movmenents on maps.
      // - they were a square with a tringle on it that pointed in the way they were facing
// - some units wounds will be how many mens are in the unit and others will be the health of a single unit
// - thinking of having units for both sides on the left and right so you can click on them for fast clicking and for better display
// - game score and account names above game board.


// DISCRIPTION OF game
// - Board broken into 10 by 10 blocks (or more)
// - You get one side each to place your units up to 10(dependent on units chosen that will take up slots)
// - maybe give first 2 rows to for placeing units
// - Underneth field will be small control pannel for controlling units.
      // - up down left right controls
      // - hold position button
      // - melee or shoot. (shooting will have a set range)
      // - maybe special attack buttons (if possible)
      // - may have secound face for placing units that goes before the first turn with 10 or 20 buttons.
// - allows movement of units(some can move further)

// BEFORE GAME
// - you and the secound player can log in if wanted or log in as guest but nothing is saved
// - each choose faction one after another
// - Then people build armies based on unit cost (number for total funds not figured out)
        // - Select formation that will auto put your units
        // - Then it will let you select units based on your fomation
                // - Have a mock board that will fill and show what you will have on the board
                // - It will highlight the area you are gonna place and wait for input
                // - once done it goes to next spot and wait for input till all spots are filled
                // - Each will have one hero which is just really powerful
                // - It will store the info of the starting spots to be used when game lanches
// - Once one player is done they lock in then the next player can choose units.

// ORDER OF HOW GAME STARTS
// 1. Once game starts first thing it does it build the board in html5 canvas
        // - first grid is built
        // - then put background in background
        // - Then activate music if put on
        // - after allow unit placement
// 2. it reads what units you have and lets you place them.
        // - There will be a list on either side or bottom with all your units
        // - click the one you wish to place,
                // - if clickable, place it on the board by clicking on space, and then the thing will lose color to show you cant use it.
                // - If not the bottom control will turn into 20 or 10 buttons depending on spaces and let you click where they will go
        // - Once all the units are done it will end your turn auto maticly
// 3. lets your opponent do it
        // - same systems will keep going.
// 4. randomly chooses who goes first
        // - It will be a random number generator and half of the numbers will choose one and the rest will do the other
// 5. Allows person to move all units or hold position
        // - First you will have to select a unit
        // - then hit one of the directions for your unit to move
                // - or hit hold position for them to stand still
        // - once movement is done automaticly lets you choose next
        // - after movement is done next part goes automaticly
// 6. Can attack with units
        // - Can only choose to do shoot or melee
        // - once chosen you choose oponent you wish to hit
        // - SHOOTING
                // - it does a simple calculation (damage - armor = extra, extra + damage = chace)
                // - Then rolls a number between 1-10 and if the chance is higher then the number damage was done
                // - then unit selected loses that many wounds.
        // - MELEE
                // - can only be done to unit 3 spaces away
                // - any unit with shooting can fire overwatch at charging unit but only hit on 8-10
                        // - This will work by looking at the units amount of shots then rolling for them
                        // - This is to make melee risky but there will be units that are really good at melee
                // - will roll a number 1-10, if 1-3 can go 1 space, if 4-6 can go 2 spaces, if 7-10 it can go full distance
                // - if you can not get to enemy you do not make it
// 7. After all units attack (may have specials after this if possible like airstrike)
        // - maybe give each faction specials they can do
// 8. Opponents turn
        // - everything that happened in the first players turn will happen in secound player
// 9. Ends when one person has no units left.
        // - Game will look at a game victory condition varrible(weither that be annilation or some kind of point system) if not met will reset to player 1s turn
        // - Have it look between each players turn if one player does not have any units if none end game.

// - counts score based on units killed
// - counts games won on account
// - save favoirte faction to account
// - save army rosters too accounts

// HOW STUFF IS STORED
// - army will be stored in an array as an object and all there stats will be stored elsewere that is reachable by the game
        // - each unit will have their own id that will help the game find the stats faster
        // - may have certain stats stored on the object of the units
// - account stuff like games won, favoirte army and saved armies will be stored in one database
// - There will be an active game database to store the stats of all active units and their wounds
